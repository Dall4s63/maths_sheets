\section*{Geometric Proof for Pythagoras' Theorem}

You might be familiar with Pythagoras' theorem for right angled
triangles. where for a right angled triangle with sides $a$, $b$, 
and $c$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse we know that 
$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2.$$
But can we be convinced that this is in fact true? it seems a 
bit outlandish.
