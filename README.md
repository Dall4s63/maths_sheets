# Maths Worksheets

This is a collection of maths worksheets I have been
writing for fun.

## Note

I am not a teacher, nor am I well educated in pedagogical 
research. So much of the explanation and question design 
is based on what I personally feel would be good.

## Completed Sheets

Much of these sheets are a work in progress, but the following
are the sheets that feel more complete.

- Plain cartesian planes are in `cartesian_plane_blank`.
  Large plane on page 1 and four small planes on page 2.
- Simple quadratic equations are in `simple_quadr_eqns`,
  `sheet.pdf` has normal questions, `ext.pdf` is incomplete.
- Formulas for non right trig are in `trig_non_right_rules`.
- Straightforward substitution word problems are in
  `subs_word_probs`.
- Some exponential plotting questions are in `exp_graphs`.
- Exact trig ratios from other exact trig ratios are 
  in `trig_exact_from_exact`.
- Conversion from gradient-intercept to and from general 
  form for line equations is in `grad_int_to_general`. 
  These questions can also be used for graphing lines.
- Shortest path and minimum spanning tree questions are in 
  `networks`, currently as `sheet.pdf`. These are missing 
  worked examples.

## Planned Sheet Ideas

- double time and half time wages
- types of triangles
- factorising with more complex terms
- factorising perfect square and diff of 2 squares
- perpendicular and parallel line equations
