# Maths Worksheets

This is a collection of maths worksheets I have been
writing for fun.

## Note

I am not a teacher, nor am I well educated in pedagogical 
research. So much of the explanation and question design 
is based on what I personally feel would be good.

## Completed Sheets

Much of these sheets are a work in progress, but the following
are the sheets that feel more complete.

- Simple quadratic equations are in `simple_quadr_eqns`
  `sheet.pdf` has normal questions, `ext.pdf` is incomplete.
- Formulas for non right trig are in `trig_non_right_rules`.
- Straightforward substitution word problems are in
  `subs_word_probs`.
